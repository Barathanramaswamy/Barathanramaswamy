Myself Barathan Ramaswamy. I want to show case a detailed account of a crime took place in my home town Tirunelveli Tamil Nadu. On 18/11/2019 early morning the PCR received a tip that the body of a small kid was lying beneath the flyover of the railway trcks near vannarapetai. Within minutes the cops arrived at the spot. It was observed that the body was of a a small boy aged between 7 to 10. There were clear signs of torture and violence. For example one of the eyes were guaged out of the socket. The small kid had undergone unspeakable terms of brutality. The seasoned cops who had dealt with several cases alike in the past were kind of stunned by the cruelty met by the small kid. All the procedures of a murder case was followed and the body was sent to the palayamkottai Government hospital for post mortem. Police had to face a lot of difficulties in identifying the the murder victim. The pictures of the dead kid were circulated throughout the police stations in tamilnadu. They couldn't find a missing complaint for victim. Posters were distributed throughout the state yet not a single clue emerged out of it. The investigation came to a dead end and the case remained unsolved for the next eleven months. In the month of December 2020 the case was officially handed over to the crime branch. Mr.K Nagaraj was the lead officer. The case details were thoroughly read over again and again. Nagaraj found that case details were circulated within the state of tamilnadu. But Nagaraj after going through the pictures of the victim came to a conclusion that the victim could not be from tamilnadu. Therefore once again the case details were forwarded not only within the but to neighbouring states. Soon they got a hit. On 11/02/2021 Nagaraj was informed that the kachigooda railway police had a missing case of a child matching the description of their victim. Immediately Nagaraj with his team reached kachigooda railway police. On 16/11/2020 a woman named farzana from filed a missing complaint of her her 8 year old son named Taheer Husnain. It was said Taheer after coming from the school went to play outside his home but never returned. Farzana with her relatives and neighbours seached for Taheer but we're unsuccessful in tracking him. The same day around 10:00 pm a missing case was filed in the second Street railway police.
